    "## Background and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "AllLife Bank is a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).\n",
    "\n",
    "A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict whether a liability customer will buy a personal loan or not.\n",
    "Which variables are most significant.\n",
    "Which segment of customers should be targeted more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the key factors influencing whether a liability customer will buy a personal loan or not?\n",
    "2. Is there a good predictive model so that we can increase the conversion rate of the campaign? \n",
    "3. What does the performance assessment look like for such a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Dictionary\n",
    "* ID: Customer ID\n",
    "* Age: Customerâ€™s age in completed years\n",
    "* Experience: #years of professional experience\n",
    "* Income: Annual income of the customer (in thousand dollars)\n",
    "* ZIP Code: Home Address ZIP code.\n",
    "* Family: the Family size of the customer\n",
    "* CCAvg: Average spending on credit cards per month (in thousand dollars)\n",
    "* Education: Education Level. 1: Undergrad; 2: Graduate;3: Advanced/Professional\n",
    "* Mortgage: Value of house mortgage if any. (in thousand dollars)\n",
    "* Personal_Loan: Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign?\n",
    "* Securities_Account: Does the customer have securities account with the bank?\n",
    "* CD_Account: Does the customer have a certificate of deposit (CD) account with the bank?\n",
    "* Online: Do customers use internet banking facilities?\n",
    "* CreditCard: Does the customer use a credit card issued by any other Bank (excluding All life Bank)?"

In this case we are not very worried about the precision score since the cost of a campaign such as direct mail marketting or emails are not significant. Based on these analysis below conclusions can be drawn :-\n",

    "- On the other hand if a customer is having Credit cards with other banks, Securities accounts or uses Internet banking facilities then the probability of taking a Personal Loan decreses.\n",
    "- Based on the customer location we can draw a conclusion that customers from counties having median income between 60K to 80K have a higher probablity of buying personal loan than other counties. \n",

    "- It also gives weightage to bigger Family size, higher Education and higher monthly average Credit crad usage. Customers matching these criterions also have higher probability of buying personal loan products.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Internet research shows people take personal loans for covering cost of emergency expense, wedding, vacation, appliance purchase, home remodelling etc. Considering the repayment capability of a customer we should target high income range costomers first as this feature has come up in both types of models and from a bank perspective these will be safer investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cusotmers having CD accounts with the bank could also be likly canditates for Personal loans. As they would have some surity as well for paying back.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customers with bigger family size such 3 or 4 members, higher Education such as graduate or advanced degrees, higher monthly Credit card usage can be targetted next. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Also customers having higher morgages, age and professional experience can be targetted for personal loans but the conversion rate may be low here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to increase the conversion rate further a personal loan social media campaing can be targetted to ZIP codes in counties where median income is between 60K to 80K per year. As analysis has shown people from these counties have higher probability of buying personal loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If customers have credit cards from other banks and lower monthly average credit card usage then they have less probability of buying personal loans as they enjoy high borrowing power already. This type of customers should be targetted less unless other features recommend otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "With above recommendations, derived from both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models, we believe conversion rate of Personal Loan campaign will increase from the current rate of 9% to higher and AllLife Banks will be better equipped in converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).\n",
